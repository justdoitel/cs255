# Fibonacci in ARM   

This code is written in ARM Assembly language. Essentially, it finds the F<sub>n</sub> and stores it in ans.  

In this instance, n is set to 13. Hence, the result would be 377 (which is F<sub>13</sub>) so ans would be set to 377.   

Note: Per the assignment's instruction, in this algorithm, the 0th and 1st fibbonaci number is 1. Hence, depending on your defintion of the fibbonaci sequence, this algorithm may find F<sub>n+1</sub>.
