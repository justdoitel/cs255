# for in ARM   

This code is written in ARM Assembly language. It sets i to 0 and then, using a for loop, finds (i)^3+(i+1)^3+(i+2)^3+....+(n-1)^3 and stores it in sum.   

In other words, this code finds 0^3+1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+....+(n-1)^3.   

In this instance, n is set to 14. Hence, at the end, sum would be 8281 (since 0^3+1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+5^3+6^3+7^3+8^3+9^3+10^3+11^3+12^3+13^3 = 8281)
