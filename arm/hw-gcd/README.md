# GCD in ARM   

This code is written in ARM Assembly language. Essentially, it finds the gcd of the number stored in r0 and the number stored in r1. After finding the gcd, it stores the answer in ans.   

In this instance, r0 is initially set to 70 while r1 is initially set to 20. Hence, in the result, ans would be 10 (since gcd(70,20) is 10).
