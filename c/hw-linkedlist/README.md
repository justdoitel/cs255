This code is written in C and it implements a linked list. As the main method shows, you can push a value to the linked list and pop from the linked list. And, to delete the linked list, you can call free_stack to deallocate the memory allocated for every node in the linked list (thereby, deleting the linked list).   

Essentially, this linked list implements a stack.
